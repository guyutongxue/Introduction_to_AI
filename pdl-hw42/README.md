# About PDL (Problem Description Language)

PDL is a language designed by a certain lab at Peking University.

## Official Brief Introduction

PDL (Problem Description Language) is a modeling language for specifying constraint optimization problems. When using PDL, users only need to list all constraints between the variables without indicating how to solve the problem -- the PDL runtime system will automatically design a feasible solving algorithm and generate the corresponding code.

## Grammar

View [pdlteam/pdl-manual](https://github.com/pdlteam/pdl-manual) for detail. We students do have a Chinese version of this manual, but I'm afraid that I can't share it here. 

## Compiler

Certainly, the compiler hasn't released yet. But it is built into an Online Judge Platform [OpenJudge](http://openjudge.cn), which is maintained by Peking University too.

You cannot find the choice to compile your code by PDL in most of the submit pages. But you might be able to find some example problems here, and be careful that it will expire at any time.
